    "There are several ways to present the output of a program, data can be printed in a human-readable form, or written to a file for future use. Sometimes users want more control over the formatting of output, rather than simply printing space-separated values. There are several ways to format output which we will cover in this section.\n",

    "The following figure (which I shamelessly copied from [here](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_formatted_output.php)) helps to visualize the `.format()` argument. If you don't understand it completely, don't worry, we'll cover it in this section:\n",

    "Everything between the double quotation marks is what will be printed (thus the `print()` statement is missing). Between curly brackets you can find lay-out options for the arguments, the arguments themselves are given within the `.format()` statement. The first number defines the argument that will be printed (Python starts counting at 0), the number behind the colon (`:`) defines the number of characters that is foreseen for the argument, and lastly the number behind the point (`.`) is only applicable for floats and defines the amount of decimals that will be printed. E.g.: `1:8.2f` will print the first argument with 8 characters/numbers of which two decimals and the type of the argument is a float. If the argument has less than 8 characters/numbers than whitespace will be used. \n",
