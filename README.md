# Gentle hands-on Python introduction
This is the material for the 'Gentle hands-on Python introduction' course. 

There are two branches in this repository. 
- The 'master' branch should contain ready-to-use materials for the course. It should be kept in a way that it is reusable for future events. 
- The 'with-solutions' branch is a temporary copy of the master branch on 26/12/2019 which contains all of the solutions before removing the exercises from the Notebooks. The latter was done for teaching purposes, when strolling through the Chapters, none of the exercises should be filled in of course...

If you like to get started with this course:
- Install Anaconda & Python3, download this repository locally, open Jupyter Lab and open the first part: 0_setup.ipynb and you're off! 
- Open [notebooks.ai](https://notebooks.ai/) in your local browser, make an account and log in, create a new project & fill in the necessary information with a link to this github repo and off you go! (Note: seems not to be working completely)



Have fun.
