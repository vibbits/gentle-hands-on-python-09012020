# Gentle hands-on Python introduction
This is the material for the 'Gentle hands-on Python introduction' course. 

If you like to get started with this course:
- Install Anaconda & Python3, download this repository locally, open Jupyter Lab and open the first part: 0_setup.ipynb and you're off! 
- Open [notebooks.ai](https://notebooks.ai/) in your local browser, make an account and log in, create a new project & fill in the necessary information with a link to this github repo and off you go! (Note: seems not to be working completely)



Have fun.
