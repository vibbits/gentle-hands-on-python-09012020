    "# 11. Modules\n",
    "*using existing code*\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.1 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "So now that we know how to make functions, how can you use them in another program if they're not inside the same file? In Python you can import a function into a file containing your code, even if the code for the function is in another file. The file with a Python function in it, is called a module. A module can also have multiple functions in it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using code in another file is possible by using **import**. In this way you can import your own functions, but also draw on a very extensive library of functions provided by Python (built-in modules). We will first look at the syntax for imports, then explore the most commonly used Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.2 How imports work\n",
    "But how exactly do imports work? Let’s say you import a module abc like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import abc\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first thing Python will do is look up the name `abc` in [`sys.modules`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.modules). This is a cache of all modules that have been previously imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name isn’t found in the module cache, Python will proceed to search through a list of built-in modules. These are modules that come pre-installed with Python and can be found in the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). If the name still isn’t found in the built-in modules, Python then searches for it in a list of directories defined by [`sys.path`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path). This list usually includes the current directory, which is searched first.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Python finds the module, it binds it to a name in the local scope. This means that `abc` is now defined and can be used in the current file without throwing a `NameError`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the name is never found, you’ll get a `ModuleNotFoundError`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.3 Import syntax \n",
    "The easiest example is importing a function from within the same directory. Let's create a Python module called 'functions1.py' with the code of the function 'getMeanValue()' that we have written earlier (and you can find here below). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Create a module in Jupyter Lab/Notebook**\n",
    "- In order to create a module in Jupyter Lab, first click on the + symbol on the top left and create a new notebook \n",
    "- Rename the notebook (e.g. 'functions1.ipynb') and copy paste the code in the notebook \n",
    "- Click 'File', 'Export Notebook as' and 'Export Notebook to Executable Script' \n",
    "- Jupyter will not download it in some local folder, make it available in your working directory (in our case in the same directory as we're in right now). \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Jupyter Lab/Notebook doesn't have a streamlined & straightforward way of creating Python modules and Python scripts. When you export the notebook, it will always export the whole Notebook and not just a part of it, which makes it very messy if you have a very large notebook. \n"
